# Employee-Productivity-Forecasting-Dashboard


## Overview
This project provides a data-driven approach to shift planning and employee management using Python and Jupyter notebooks. It includes data preprocessing, analysis, and shift planning functionality to help optimize workforce scheduling.

## Project Structure
- `preprocessing.ipynb`: Initial data preprocessing and cleaning
- `final_preprocessing.ipynb`: Enhanced data preparation pipeline
- `shifPlannig.ipynb`: Main shift planning and scheduling algorithms
- `Example_dataset.csv`: Sample dataset for testing and demonstration
- `employee-Punch-in.ipynb`: Employee time tracking analysis
- Additional notebooks for development and testing (`newcode_*.ipynb`)

## Dataset
The project uses employee data stored in CSV format (`Example_dataset.csv`). The dataset contains information about:
- Employee schedules
- Punch-in/out times
- Shift patterns

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. Install required dependencies
```bash
pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Usage
1. Start with `preprocessing.ipynb` or `final_preprocessing.ipynb` to prepare your data
2. Use `shifPlannig.ipynb` for the main shift planning functionality
3. Analyze employee punch-in data using `employee-Punch-in.ipynb`
